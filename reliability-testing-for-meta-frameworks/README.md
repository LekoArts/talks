# Reliability Testing for Meta-Frameworks

Ever wondered how meta-frameworks test that their software is reliable against OS and browser differences, ad blockers, slow network speeds or other disturbances? That configuration options and core functionalities work in all cases, end-to-end on all platforms? That's what the makers of Gatsby, one of the largest React meta-frameworks, did to ensure resilience and reliability. In this talk you'll learn from their experiences and discover some techniques you can also adopt in your own web projects.
