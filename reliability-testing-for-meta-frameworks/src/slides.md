  ## Reliability Testing for Meta-Frameworks

  Ever wondered how meta-frameworks test that their software is reliable against OS and browser differences, ad blockers, slow network speeds or other disturbances? That configuration options and core functionalities work in all cases, end-to-end on all platforms? That's what the makers of Gatsby, one of the largest React meta-frameworks, did to ensure resilience and reliability. In this talk you'll learn from their experiences and discover some techniques you can also adopt in your own web projects.

# Why?

<!--
So why is it important to test the reliablity of your framework? I want to show you some examples.

# ‚ÄúI can rebuild this framework in a weekend‚Äù

<!--
You surely have seen such comments on the internet. But I'm then always thinking...

## What could possibly go wrong?

<br />

<v-clicks>

- Inconsistencies between operating systems & browsers
- Browser extensions like Ad-Blockers
- Flaky, slow internet
- Deployment of new artifacts
- Framework Bugs üêû

... A lot of things can go wrong

## Building a reliable framework is hard

<v-click>

But you can automate a lot of testing

</v-click>

<!--
With unit & E2E tests

# Foundations

<!--
Independent on how you view the testing pyramid (listen to the talk "The Pyramid is Dead, Long Live the Pyramid" later), you can give yourself a solid foundation by going the extra mile during initial test setup.

## Operating Systems

Different path separators:

```shell
# Linux
/some/path

# Windows
\\some\\path
```

ESM loader:

```js
/* Linux */
await import(somePath)

/* Windows */
await import(pathToFileURL(somePath).href)
```
